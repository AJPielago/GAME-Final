# Auto-Load Game State Fix

## 🐛 Problem
**Issue:** Game was saving properly to the database, but when the page was reloaded, the player would start at the spawn point instead of their saved position. All progress (XP, coins, quests) was lost on reload.

**Root Cause:** The game was saving data but NOT automatically loading it when the page started. The `start()` function only loaded the player profile (basic info) but didn't restore the game state (position, quests, rewards, etc.).

---

## ✅ Solution

### Added `autoLoadGameState()` Function
A new function that automatically loads and restores the complete game state when the page loads.

**Location:** `public/js/game.js` lines 2937-3016

### What It Does:
1. **Fetches saved data** from `/game/load` endpoint
2. **Restores player profile:**
   - Name, level, XP, coins
   - Badges, achievements, stats
3. **Restores player position:**
   - X and Y coordinates
   - Player spawns at saved location
4. **Restores game progress:**
   - Collected rewards (won't respawn)
   - Active quests
   - Completed quests
   - NPC interactions
   - Player direction and animation
5. **Falls back gracefully:**
   - If no save found → starts fresh
   - If load fails → starts fresh
   - No errors thrown

## 🔄 Game Flow

### Before Fix:
```
Page Load → Initialize Game → Load Profile → Start at Spawn Point
                                              ❌ Saved position ignored
```

### After Fix:
```
Page Load → Initialize Game → Load Profile → Auto-Load Game State → Start at Saved Position
                                                                     ✅ Everything restored
```

## 📝 Code Changes

### Modified `start()` function:
```javascript
// Added after profile loading
updateLoadingProgress('Loading saved game...', 90);

// Auto-load saved game state from player account
await autoLoadGameState();
```

### New `autoLoadGameState()` function:
```javascript
async function autoLoadGameState() {
  try {
    // Fetch saved data from server
    const response = await fetch('/game/load', { ... });
    
    // Restore player profile
    playerProfile.pixelCoins = saveData.pixelCoins;
    playerProfile.experience = saveData.experience;
    // ... etc
    
    // Restore player position
    player.x = saveData.playerPosition.x;
    player.y = saveData.playerPosition.y;
    
    // Restore game state
    gameState.collectedRewards = new Set(saveData.collectedRewards);
    gameState.activeQuests = new Set(saveData.activeQuests);
    // ... etc
    
  } catch (error) {
    // Start fresh if load fails
  }
}
```
