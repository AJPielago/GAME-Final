## 🔧 Technical Details

### Removed Functions:
```javascript
// ❌ REMOVED - No more localStorage operations
localStorage.setItem('codequest_save', JSON.stringify(saveData));
localStorage.getItem('codequest_save');
localStorage.removeItem('codequest_save');
localStorage.setItem('codequest_save_backup', JSON.stringify(basicSaveData));
```

### Current Save Flow:
```javascript
// ✅ NEW - Database only
1. User triggers save (manual or auto)
2. Build complete save payload
3. Send to /game/save endpoint
4. Server validates and saves to MongoDB
5. Success/error notification shown
```

### 🆕 Auto-Load on Startup:
```javascript
// ✅ NEW - Automatically loads saved game when page loads
1. Game initializes (map, sprites, controllers)
2. autoLoadGameState() is called
3. Fetches saved data from /game/load endpoint
4. Restores player position, stats, and progress
5. Game starts from saved position (not spawn point)
```

**Key Features:**
- Automatic restoration of player position
- Restores all progress (XP, coins, badges, quests)
- Restores collected rewards and NPC interactions
- Falls back to fresh start if no save found
- Silent operation (no user interaction needed)

## 📊 Save Data Structure

All saves include:
- **Player Info:** name, inGameName, level, experience, pixelCoins
- **Progress:** badges, achievements, gameStats
- **Game State:** position, direction, animation
- **Quest Data:** collectedRewards, activeQuests, completedQuests, interactedNPCs

---

## 🚨 Important Notes

1. **No Offline Play:** Game requires server connection to save
2. **Account-Based:** Each player's progress is tied to their account
3. **Auto-Save:** Happens automatically when earning rewards/XP/badges
4. **Manual Save:** Available in settings menu (M key or gear icon)
5. **Error Handling:** Game continues even if save fails (error logged)

---

## 🔍 Debugging

If saves are still failing, check:

1. **Server Console:** Look for detailed error messages
   - Validation errors
   - Database connection issues
   - Authentication problems

2. **Browser Console:** Check for:
   - Network errors (500, 401, etc.)
   - Request/response data
   - Error messages

3. **Database:** Verify:
   - MongoDB is running
   - User schema matches data structure
   - User is authenticated (session valid)
