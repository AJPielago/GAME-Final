Originally called 'Mocha', then 'LiveScript', it was finally renamed 'JavaScript' to ride the wave of Java's popularity. Despite the name similarity, JavaScript and Java are completely different languages!\n\nJavaScript was created to make web pages interactive. Before JavaScript, websites were just static documents. With JavaScript, developers could create dynamic content, respond to user actions, and build the interactive web we know today.\n\nToday, JavaScript runs not just in browsers, but on servers (Node.js), mobile apps, desktop applications, and even IoT devices. It has become one of the most popular programming languages in the world!",

      title: "JavaScript Building Blocks",
      content: "Now that you know JavaScript's history, let's learn how to actually use it! JavaScript is built on a few fundamental concepts that you'll use in every program you write.\n\nFirst, we have variables - containers that store data. Think of them like labeled boxes where you can put different types of information.\n\nNext, we have data types - different kinds of information JavaScript can work with: numbers, text (strings), true/false values (booleans), and more.\n\nFinally, we have functions - reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks. Functions are like recipes - you write them once and can use them many times!",
      examples: [
        "// Variables store data\nlet playerName = 'CodeWarrior';\nlet playerLevel = 1;\nlet hasWeapon = true;",
